## Introduction
QuestDB is a relational column-oriented database, which is particularly optimised for time-series and with familiar SQL. We are free from third-party dependencies and built for ultimate performance and scalability. QuestDB pushes your hardware to the maximum and can run fast on high-end servers as well as minimal portable edge devices alike.

## Why QuestDB
Most of the innovations surrounding databases have been geared towards the hardware rather than the software itself. While tremendous progress has been made on parallelisation, software's core efficiency has stalled.

QuestDB's dev team consists of low-latency developers who worked in HFT. Our approach is unique: rather than immediately focusing on scaling and parallelisation, we dedicated over 5 years toward R&D to maximise single-thread performance. As such, we achieve maximum efficiency for a given unit of hardware. The result is that QuestDBâ€™s performance on a single thread is already multiples times faster than multi-threaded databases.

## Who can use QuestDB
QuestDB can cover most of database needs. However it is particularly suited for users who:
- Store large data sets (particularly time-series), and optimise disk space
- Undertake heavy data processing and minimise computation related costs
- Want to maximise each unit of hardware to the fullest rather than upgrade or purchase more servers
