QuestDB is a cross-platform package with no dependencies other than Java Runtime. We tried to keep package size to a
minimum and it currently weighs in at a whopping 4Mb.

Installing QuestDB is as simple as unzipping files and running a platform-specific executable. 
For detailed instructions on how to do that refer to [Install from Binary page](installFromBinary.md).

If you wish to use orchestration tools that use Docker, we have provided docker images for your platform. Refer to 
[Install from Docker image page](installFromDockerImage.md) for more details.
