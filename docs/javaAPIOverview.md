- Zero-GC, low latency date arithmetic library (millisecond resolution)
- Zero-GC, low latency timestamp arithmetic library (microsecond resolution)
- Primitive collections with low computational overhead
- Zero-GC, low latency Logger
- Zero-GC, cross-platform network library (EPoll, KQueue, Select)
- Zero-GC, cross-platform file system library
- Low latency data storage
- Embedded, Zero-GC HTTP server
