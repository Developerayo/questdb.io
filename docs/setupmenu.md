Choose how you would like to run QuestDB:

### As a Docker container

Docker is a convenient method to have QuestDB running very quickly via simple commands. You will of course need Docker
to be installed on your system. QuestDB has images for Windows, Linux and ARM64 Linux as well as manifest to automatically
download correct image for your target architecture.
