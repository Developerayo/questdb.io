Revenue increase potential for exchanges from using QuestDB 

Use case #1: speed, reliability and accuracy for leveraged trading
QuestDB can sum up every order position in the system every time a client places an order. 
As such, the integrity of the system during the trading process is guaranteed, and checked at extremely high speed. 
This is a must for exchanges who offer leverage on their products as they require a real-time risk management overlay.

$ opportunity
Introduction of leverage enables people to trade more. This usually multiplies trading volume from retail.
Safely and reliably increase leverage capabilities, which means more revenue potential. 
⇒ Quantification of revenue gains: Assuming 0.20% blended fees and $5bn volume per month, an increase of 
50% / 100% / 200% traded volume would yield $5m / $10m / $20m per month extra revenue. 


Use case #2: cutting latency to increase throughput and trading volume
QuestDB can reduce latency and fix the following problems; order submission problems, and lack of liquidity caused by the absence of market makers.

Order submission problems:
Optimize order cancellation, placement actions in the trading engine, reworking internal data-structures, 
audit checks. BitMex went through a similar revamp through the database Kx, which yielded 10x performance improvement. 
The performance enhancements delivered to the trading engine resulted in the elimination of all overloads.

$ opportunity 
Eliminate overload to increase trading volume. 
Decreases risk for market makers and arbitrageurs. 
Attracts more institutional investors to the exchange, thus increasing volumes.

Reputational benefits, attracting more flow.
⇒ Quantification of revenue gains: Assuming 0.20% blended fees and $5bn volume per month, an increase of 10% / 20% / 50% 
traded volume would yield $1m / $2m /$5m per month extra revenue.



1 - Leveraged  trading

- Context: Enabling leverage allows customers to trade more (usually multiples of their normal trading volume). However, 
this introduces risk on the exchange side. Additionally, the real-time monitoring of risk is complex and puts pressure on the system
which can break under pressure.

- Offering: QuestDB can save trades / orders, and sum up positions at extremely high speed ensuring no lockdowns. It can
be used to reliably manage risk and enable leveraged trading.

- Risk: Not developing leverage and losing market share and volume.
Potential decrease 10 - 50 % of volume

- Opportunity: Make leverage available and multiply volume. Maintain or increase market share
Potential increase of 50% - 200% of volume


2 - Reputation

- Context: Retail and Market-Makers avoid non-performing exchanges as they cannot exit positions in volatile markets.
This is critical for exchanges as volatile markets are usually where a significant fraction of the volume is traded.

- Offering: Reduce latency to eliminate throughput issues allowing for the system to constantly be up and running.

- Risk: Losing market share to more reliable exchanges.
Potential decrease 10 - 50 % of volume

- Risk: Losing trading revenue during downtime.
Potential downtime of 10mn - 1hr per day

- Opportunity: Gain market share by gaining a reputation of reliability
Potential increase 10 - 50 % of volume

Decrease of 10% / 20% / 50% volume > $1m / $2m /$5m per month lost revenue*
